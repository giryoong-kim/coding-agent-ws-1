"""Tests for the orchestrator agent: the brain (chat.py) and its thin AgentCore
wrapper (main.py). The Strands tools are REAL.

The orchestrator is a CHATBOT: the model converses and only dispatches an agent
when it chooses to call a dispatch_*/run_build tool. These tests prove the tool
wiring without a model call: list_presets reads the real preset registry; the dispatch tools
kick a REAL run on the engine (non-blocking) and we poll it to a terminal verdict
through the validator's authored gate. The engine is REAL-ONLY (it would dispatch to deployed
runtimes and fail loud without them), so the test injects the test-only
FixtureExecutor by constructor: the same seam the shipped binary never exposes
via a flag. The Strands agent loop itself (which calls Bedrock) is exercised live
in the workshop and by the console smoke tests.

# would poll an engine that never ran the fixture build. Re-pinning per test makes
