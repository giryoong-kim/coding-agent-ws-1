  Umbrella entrypoint for standing up the 3-agent AgentCore coding-agent harness end to end.
  Use when the user says "set up the harness", "configure the agents", "first time setup",
  "deploy the coding agents", "bootstrap the harness", "get the agents running",
  "stand up the harness", "wire up the orchestrator", or "I just cloned this, what do I run".
  Drives the full bring-up: shared infra -> GitHub MCP Gateway -> the three per-agent skills
  (backend / validator / frontend) -> orchestrator run, with a confirm-region/agents gather step
  and a closing smoke-test checklist. Dispatches to configure-claude-code-backend, configure-kiro-validator,
  and configure-opencode-frontend rather than duplicating their steps.

# Set up the AgentCore coding-agent harness

You are configuring OUR workshop harness: three autonomous coding agents behind a single
orchestrator (deterministic glue around one agentic step).
This is the **umbrella** skill: it sequences the shared infrastructure and then hands each
agent off to its own focused skill. Do not inline the per-agent deploy steps here; dispatch.

## Role mapping (LOCKED, do not reassign)

This harness has a fixed division of labor. Echo it back to the user before you start so the
roles are unambiguous:

| Agent | Role | Identity model | Per-agent skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | **BACKEND**: implements the backend deliverable the task names and exposes it through the AgentCore Gateway | Bedrock native, runtime IAM role has `bedrock:InvokeModel`, **no API key** | `configure-claude-code-backend` |
| **Kiro** | **VALIDATOR**: reads the task and the builders' work, authors a self-contained executable check, the engine runs it, and its real exit code is the gate | Token Vault (AgentCore Identity): **your own `ksk_` key**, fetched at session start, in memory only, never on disk and never a runtime env var | `configure-kiro-validator` |
| **opencode** | **FRONTEND BUILDER**: builds the interface on top of the backend | Bedrock native, runtime IAM role through the AWS SDK credential chain | `configure-opencode-frontend` |

Framing: this is an **autonomous, fire-and-forget** pipeline. The orchestrator handles the
deterministic work (admission, context hydration, pre-flight, finalization); the three agents
are the agentic step fanned into isolated roles. Each builder gets ONE pull request of its own
against the default branch, checked and reviewed and merged on its own: no combined candidate,
no merge queue, no separate final PR. There is **no race, no winner, no fastest/cheapest
ranking**: every agent has a job and does it.

> Per-agent **model routing** is each agent's own concern (Sonnet for new tasks,
> Haiku for read-only review, Opus opt-in for complex repos). The umbrella skill only confirms
> region and which agents to configure; the per-agent skills own model selection. New agent
> types extend the harness the same way: add a sibling skill, keep this dispatch table the
> contract.

## Step 1: Gather inputs (region + which agents)

Before running anything, confirm scope with an AskUserQuestion-style prompt. At a staffed
workshop event the shared infra and Gateway are usually **pre-provisioned**; ask so you can
skip Steps 2 to 3 instead of re-deploying.

Ask:

- **Region**: default `us-west-2`. All commands in the base repos assume it; Bedrock model
  access (Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku for Claude Code and opencode) must be enabled there.
  - Options: `us-west-2 (recommended)` / `other (specify)`
- **Shared infra + Gateway already provisioned?** (typical at an event)
  - Options: `Yes: skip to Step 4 (verify Gateway, then deploy agents)` / `No: I'm starting from scratch (run Steps 2-3)`
- **Which agents to configure?**
  - Options: `All three (backend + validator + frontend)` / `Backend only (Claude Code)` / `Validator only (Kiro)` / `Frontend only (opencode)` / `Custom subset`

Capture the answers; everything below keys off them. Export region once so later commands inherit it:

```bash
export AWS_REGION="us-west-2"   # or the region the user chose
aws sts get-caller-identity      # confirm you're in the intended account before deploying
```

## Step 2: Shared infrastructure (deploy ONCE)

> Skip if the user said infra is pre-provisioned. This stands up the shared VPC + S3 Files
> mount that every agent runtime attaches to. Run it exactly once per account/region.

```bash
cd coding-agents/infra
./setup.sh us-west-2          # shared VPC + S3 Files; idempotent-ish, but don't double-run needlessly
```

Prereqs if this is a truly fresh machine (event boxes already have these):

```bash
pip install -r coding-agents/requirements.txt
pip install awscurl              # used to verify the Gateway in Step 4
gh auth status                   # GitHub MCP server needs an authenticated gh / GitHub App
```

## Step 3: GitHub MCP Gateway (deploy FIRST among the moving parts)

> Skip if pre-provisioned. The Gateway is the single MCP endpoint the backend agent's runtime
> wires into `~/.mcp.json`. It must exist before the agents run, so deploy it before Step 5.

```bash
cd coding-agents/gateway_mcp
export GITHUB_APP_ID="123456"
export GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="/path/to/your-app.private-key.pem"
export GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID="78901234"
export AWS_REGION="us-west-2"
./deploy-all.sh    # stores GitHub creds in Secrets Manager, builds+pushes the MCP container to ECR,
                   # creates the IAM role, AgentCore Runtime (MCP) + Gateway (IAM-auth)
```

Never commit the GitHub App private key, App ID, or installation ID; they are passed by
env/file only.

## Step 4: Verify the Gateway responds (`tools/list`)

Confirm the Gateway is live and brokering GitHub tools before you point agents at it. The URL
is saved to `.deployed-state.json`:

```bash
GATEWAY_URL=$(jq -r '.gateway_url' coding-agents/gateway_mcp/.deployed-state.json)
awscurl --service bedrock-agentcore --region "$AWS_REGION" -X POST "$GATEWAY_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1,"params":{}}'
```

Expect a JSON-RPC result listing GitHub tools (issues, code, etc.). If this fails, fix the
Gateway before deploying agents; a missing Gateway makes every backend run fail pre-flight.

## Step 5: Dispatch to the per-agent skills (per the Step 1 selection)

Do NOT inline agent deploys here. Invoke the focused skill for each selected agent so the
identity model and model routing stay owned in one place. Suggested order: backend first
(it is the deliverable under test), then validator (it gates that deliverable), then frontend:

1. **BACKEND: Claude Code** -> run skill `configure-claude-code-backend`
   - Bedrock native (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`), no API key. Roughly:
     ```bash
     cd coding-agents/claude-code && ./setup.sh && python deploy.py
     ```
2. **VALIDATOR: Kiro** -> run skill `configure-kiro-validator`
   - Token Vault (AgentCore Identity) with the attendee's own `ksk_` key. Roughly:
     ```bash
     cd coding-agents/kiro && KIRO_API_KEY=ksk_xxx ./setup.sh && python deploy.py
     ```
   - No key minted yet? `./setup.sh --skip-identity` builds and deploys keyless, and
     the key is added later on the wired instance in console Settings.
3. **FRONTEND: opencode** -> run skill `configure-opencode-frontend`
   - Bedrock native, runtime IAM role; no API key or Token Vault provider. Roughly:
     ```bash
     cd coding-agents/opencode && ./setup.sh && python deploy.py
     ```

The snippets above are orientation only; the per-agent skill is the source of truth for flags,
model overrides, and identity. If the user picked "All three", you can also fan out the bare
deploys with the repo's batch script, then still run each skill for verification:

```bash
cd coding-agents && ./deploy-all.sh        # builds+deploys all agents; per-agent skills then verify each
```

## Step 6: Point at the orchestrator run

Once the selected agents are deployed and verified, the harness is ready for an autonomous run.
Hand off to the orchestrator (single-chat, fire-and-forget): submit ONE task and the blueprint
runs admission -> context hydration -> pre-flight -> agent execution (the three roles) ->
finalization -> acceptance gate -> PR. See `orchestrator/` in this repo.

The acceptance gate works as follows: after the builder roles complete, the validator role
reads the task (`WORKSHOP_TASK`) and the work (`WORKSHOP_WORK_DIR`), authors one
self-contained executable, and the engine runs it. The check's real exit code decides. A
non-zero exit is ONE bounded retry PER PULL REQUEST, then escalate to a human. Nothing in the repo
pre-encodes what a correct answer looks like; the validator decides based on the deliverable
in front of it.

## Step 7: Smoke-test checklist

Walk this before declaring the harness ready. Each item is a concrete, observable check:

- [ ] **Identity/account**: `aws sts get-caller-identity` shows the intended account, and
      `AWS_REGION` is the region from Step 1.
- [ ] **Shared infra**: `coding-agents/infra/setup.sh` completed (or confirmed pre-provisioned);
      VPC + S3 Files exist.
- [ ] **Gateway live**: Step 4 `tools/list` returns a non-empty tool list with no JSON-RPC error.
- [ ] **Backend (Claude Code)**: `python deploy.py` succeeded; runtime registered; an interactive
      `python connect.py` session opens (verified by `configure-claude-code-backend`).
- [ ] **Validator (Kiro)**: deployed with its Token Vault credential provider (the key in the
      vault, never on the ARN); runtime READY (verified by `configure-kiro-validator`).
- [ ] **Frontend (opencode)**: deployed AND runtime IAM role verified
      (verified by `configure-opencode-frontend`); the frontend reaches the backend MCP endpoint.
- [ ] **End-to-end run**: submit one request to the orchestrator and confirm it reaches a terminal
      state where the validator authored a check, the engine ran it, and the real exit code
      decided (PR opened, or a clear fail-closed reason like `GITHUB_UNREACHABLE` /
      `REPO_NOT_FOUND_OR_NO_ACCESS`).
- [ ] **No secrets committed**: GitHub App key/IDs, account ids, and tokens were passed by env/file
      only and are absent from the working tree. A `ksk_` Kiro key is NEVER committed and never
      echoed into a terminal transcript: it lives in the Token Vault and is read at session start.

If any item fails, fix it (or re-run the owning per-agent skill) before handing off. Cost is a
first-class concern but illustrative here; a small autonomous run is dollars of Bedrock
inference + compute, dominated by tokens, not by Lambda/DynamoDB. Quote the workshop's own
measured per-agent metrics from the run, never vendor "Nx cheaper" claims.

## Teardown (when the user is done)

```bash
python coding-agents/claude-code/cleanup.py
python coding-agents/opencode/cleanup.py
python coding-agents/kiro/cleanup.py
cd coding-agents/infra && ./cleanup.sh      # removes VPC + S3 Files (keeps the S3 bucket)
cd coding-agents/gateway_mcp && ./delete-all.sh
```
