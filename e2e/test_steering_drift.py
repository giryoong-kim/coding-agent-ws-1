"""Role steering has ONE source, and it describes the ROLE, never the deliverable.

Two failure modes are pinned here, and the first one already happened:

1. **Drift between the shipped steering and the BAKED copy.** Each role's steering
   lives at ``orchestrator/harness/<role>/<file>`` (what Lab 1 scaffolds and what the
   orchestrator stages onto the mount) and is COPIED into the container image from
   ``coding-agents/<role>/<file>`` by its Dockerfile. The baked copy is what the agent
   reads whenever the mount has no steering yet, which is exactly the event's
   pre-deploy state. So a stale baked copy silently steers a live agent with
   instructions nobody can see in the repo's source of truth. They must be identical.

2. **Steering that encodes the answer.** The attendee's request is whatever they type,
   so steering that names a specific module, protocol, filename, or expected value is
   the predetermined-answer problem this workshop exists to remove: it tells the agent
   what to build before anyone asked. The dead ``harness:build`` / ``harness:ui`` /
   ``harness:gate`` blocks are checked for too, because their PARSER IS DELETED, which
   makes them config that looks live and is not.
