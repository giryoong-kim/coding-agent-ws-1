"""Regression: harness deploy.py IAM policies must never emit empty-string ARNs.

Every coding-agent harness (`coding-agents/<role>/deploy.py`) is designed to deploy
MOUNTLESS first: the attendee creates the S3 Files access point on Stage 1, so at
predeploy time ``INFRA_S3FILES_AP_ARN`` is empty. The S3Files IAM statement must
still be a valid policy in that state.

The concrete bug this pins (found live on a fresh event box, 2026-07-08): the
backend `claude-code/deploy.py` inlined the AP ARN straight into the statement's
``Resource`` list::

    "Resource": [
        S3FILES_AP_ARN,                                 # "" when mountless
        S3FILES_AP_ARN.rsplit("/access-point/", 1)[0],  # "" too
    ],

With no access point yet, both entries are the empty string and
``iam.put_role_policy`` rejects the whole document with
``MalformedPolicyDocument: Resource must be in ARN format or "*"``, so
``python deploy.py`` (Lab 1 backend deploy) crashes before the runtime is created.
opencode / kiro already routed the same statement through a
``_s3files_policy_resources()`` helper that returns account-scoped wildcards when
the AP is unknown; claude-code was the one harness missing it.

Kiro is now a SERVED role (the validator), so its deploy.py is held to the served-role
invariants too, not just this one: see ``test_region_is_never_hardcoded.py``, which
requires its ``REGION_MISMATCH`` same-region guard.

We assert EVERY harness with a deploy.py resolves its mountless S3Files resources to
real ARNs (no empty string, each ``arn:`` or ``*``), by importing each deploy module
with a mountless (empty-AP) infra config. The list deliberately includes the hidden
restore paths (``claude-code-validator``, ``codex``): a restore path whose deploy
crashes is not a working restore.
