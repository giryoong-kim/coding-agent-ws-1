"""Reasoning effort is set HIGH by default, on every surface, and stays wirable.

These roles are handed real projects (several features, real persistence, real input
rejection) and their work is graded by an executable another agent wrote. Thinking less
does not buy a cheaper run: it buys a red gate and a wasted re-implement round.

The flag names were verified against the INSTALLED CLIs, not assumed:
  * `claude --effort` accepts low|medium|high|xhigh|max, and WARNS-and-ignores anything
    else ("Unknown --effort value 'bogus' - ignoring it and using the default effort"),
    so a bad value degrades instead of failing a run.
  * opencode calls it a model VARIANT (`--variant`), values provider-specific.
  * opencode has NEVER had `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: it is absent from
    `opencode run --help` in 1.18.x and passing it errors the run. It uses `--auto`.
