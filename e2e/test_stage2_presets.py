"""Stage 2 routing over HTTP: roles are chosen, requests are never classified.

Workshop step: an attendee submits ONE request. It can be ANY request, because nothing
in this repository knows what they will ask for. Admission therefore does exactly one
thing before any agent runs, it resolves which ROLES work, and then only those roles
dispatch.

This replaced a suite that asserted a regex ladder mapping the attendee's prose onto
bundled sample use cases. That ladder is gone: it answered the question before the
agents saw it, and every one of its tests was really a test of our keyword list.

What is worth asserting, and what these tests cover:
  * an arbitrary sentence runs (the headline property)
  * a preset supplies its own request text and role set
  * only the routed roles get a lane, and a build always routes the checker
  * bad input fails LOUD (unknown preset, unknown role, nothing specified), never a
    nearest match and never an invented task

Stage 2 runs in the deterministic LOCAL engine (no model). A submitted run routes on a
worker thread, so route facts come from poll_route; a run rejected at admission never
attaches a route, so those are asserted via the failed terminal status + reason.
