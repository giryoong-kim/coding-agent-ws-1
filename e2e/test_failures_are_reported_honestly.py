"""Two rules about how a failure is REPORTED, both broken on a live us-east-1 box.

1. Never blame the agent for our bug. "finished but wrote no files" is a claim about
   the AGENT. When the runtime workspace still holds the work, that claim is FALSE
   and it sends the reader to debug an agent that did its job.

2. A hang must become a failure. ``timeout_s`` was checked only inside
   ``async for frame in shell``, so a shell that connected and then went silent
   never tripped it: two jobs sat 9m02s (limit 600s) and 4m32s (limit 180s) with
   zero output before being killed by hand. A run that hangs reports no verdict at
   all, which is strictly worse than any red gate.
