"""The check must be told how long it has.

Four consecutive live runs in us-east-1 failed their authored check on a READINESS
POLL, not on a wrong answer:

  run_032941_001 iter 2  "server stopped responding to /health within 30 seconds"
  run_032941_002 iter 1  same
  run_032941_002 iter 2  "started successfully ... then immediately shut down"
  run_045143_001 iter 1  "didn't detect the server as ready within 15 seconds,
                          even though uvicorn actually started successfully"

The validator budgeted 15-30s for a first start that was still preparing declared
dependencies. Nothing in the code tells the validator how much of the enforced wall
clock remains.

Those were RED GATES ON WORKING SERVICES, which is the one verdict this engine must
never manufacture. A gate is allowed to reject bad work; it is not allowed to reject
work because the checker under-waited.

The fix keeps validation agentic. `WORKSHOP_GATE_TIMEOUT_S` is a fact about the
ENVIRONMENT (the wall clock the engine will enforce anyway), not a hint about the
verdict: it says nothing about what to verify or what a correct answer looks like. The
validator still decides every check, the language, and the file.
