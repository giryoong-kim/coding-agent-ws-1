"""End-to-end proof of the WHOLE workshop loop, the way a real attendee runs it.

No LLM, no AWS, no network beyond localhost. This test walks the exact path the content
teaches and asserts that each stage produces the real thing the next stage consumes, and
 the part that actually matters, that the deliverable is **built from the harness**, so
editing a harness file changes what comes out. That is the workshop's central claim, and
this suite makes it mechanical instead of theatre.

  Stage 1 (Interactive)  shell orchestration: boot the interactive engine, deploy an
                         agent, open a session, and run REAL /bin/sh commands in the
                         /mnt/s3files workspace. The mount starts empty; the attendee
                         types any request into the agent's live terminal.
  Stage 2 (Orchestrate)  submit ONE task to the embedded orchestration engine; the
                         blueprint runs; the backend role GENERATES the deliverable from
                         its CLAUDE.md, the frontend role GENERATES the UI from its
                         AGENTS.md, the validator role AUTHORS an executable check whose
                         real exit code is the gate, and the three roles are composed
                         into ONE git commit.
  Stage 3 (Governance)   the run lands in the shared telemetry ledger and the metrics
                         API aggregates it (per-user, per-agent, p95).
