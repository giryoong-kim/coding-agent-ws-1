"""The validator must be TOLD, in the dispatch prompt, to start the deliverable.

Its steering has always said so, but the steering is read from the working
directory while the dispatch prompt is what the agent is handed for this specific
task. A live run produced a check whose only assertion was "is something already
listening on port 3000", which nothing was: the gate went red twice on a WORKING
deliverable and the run ended `needs_human`. The instruction has to be in the
prompt, not only in the steering.
