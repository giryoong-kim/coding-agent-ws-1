"""Interactive API for the Development workspace and deployed-agent catalog.

Deploy ONE coding agent, open an interactive shell into its workspace, run commands,
and do a single module-to-MCP conversion by hand:

    python3 interactive-api/interactive_api.py        # serves http://localhost:8091

Everything observable is real work on this machine:
  - POST /api/agents/deploy   reconciles the agent against its deployed Runtime:
    it reads the `runtime_config.json` the harness `deploy.py` wrote (an
    `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:...:runtime/...` from `CreateAgentRuntime`) and flips
    the agent to `ready` ONLY when that ARN exists; otherwise it stays
    `deploying`. No `local:runtime` placeholder is ever written.
  - POST /api/sessions        creates a workspace directory on disk
    (.runs/stage1/<session>/workspace) and the session opens when the directory
    exists. `/mnt/s3files` in the UI
    maps to that dir (the same path the S3 Files mount uses on a Runtime).
  - POST /api/sessions/{id}/input  executes the command with /bin/sh in the session's
    cwd (10s timeout, output capped). `cd` is tracked. State persists across
    inputs because the files persist on disk.
  - Every session/conversion appends to the shared telemetry ledger
    (`.runs/telemetry.jsonl`) with the OS user used for local attribution.

On AgentCore the same contract maps to: deploy = `./setup.sh && python deploy.py`
(image -> Runtime), session = `agentcore exec --it` (command-shell PTY into the
microVM), and the workspace persistence is S3 Files / managed session storage. The
HTTP shapes do not change.

This stage is ONE agent, by hand: no fan-out, no gate, no PR. That's Stage 2.
