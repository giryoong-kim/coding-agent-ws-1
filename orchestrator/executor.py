"""The execution seam: which producer makes each role's artifact.

The engine drives the same five-phase blueprint no matter where the agents
execute. The producer is what sits behind this seam, and the shipped
orchestrator is real-only:

  * ``AgentCoreExecutor``: the shipped default. A role is dispatched to a coding
    agent already DEPLOYED on its own AgentCore Runtime: the role's CLI runs inside
    that Runtime over the command shell (``engine._runtime_cli`` /
    ``bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime``), writes its artifact there, and the
    engine reads it back. A role with no wired runtime ARN FAILS LOUD; there is no
    local, in-process, or model-in-process producer to fall back to.

Deterministic OFFLINE TESTS inject a test-only ``FixtureExecutor``
(``fixture_executor.py``) by constructor: it runs the role closures in-process and
the closures route their PRODUCE step to the deterministic builders. That double
lives only in test-support code; no env flag selects a fake on the shipped binary.

The engine selects its executor at startup from ``WORKSHOP_EXECUTOR`` (default /
``""`` / ``agentcore`` -> ``AgentCoreExecutor``; unknown values fail loud). Picking
the seam never alters the verdict path: the executed gate is still the only acceptance
authority, and the reviewer still runs in its separate pen.
