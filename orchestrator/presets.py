"""Routing: which ROLES handle a request. That is the entire job.

The attendee types any request they like. Nothing in this repository knows what it
will be, so routing cannot and must not decide anything about the work itself: no
target shape, no language, no protocol, no sample module, no expected answer. It picks
a role set and stops.

This replaced a router that pattern-matched the attendee's prose against a registry of
canned workflows, each bound to a bundled sample use case. That design answered the
question before the agents saw it, which is the opposite of what the workshop teaches.

Three ways in:

  * ``roles``: name the roles directly, with any request text at all.
  * ``preset``: one of the starting points below, which is a REQUEST TEXT plus a role
    set. Presets exist so an attendee who arrives without an idea starts in a minute;
    they are examples, not a menu the system is limited to.
  * a REQUEST ALONE, which is the ordinary case: the attendee types a sentence and
    names nothing. The MODEL then reads it and picks the capabilities the work calls
    for, so a command line tool gets no frontend builder. That decision is a judgement
    and it is made by a model, never by a keyword table here.

Fail-loud rules, all of them structural, and none of them a judgement about the work:

  * An unknown preset or an unknown role raises. Never a nearest match.
  * An EMPTY request raises, so the coordinator ASKS instead of inventing a task.
  * A build always routes the CHECKER. Validation is agentic: with no validator there
    is no authored acceptance check, and with no check the gate is red by definition. A
    build nobody can verify is not a smaller build, it is an unverifiable one.
  * A build always routes at least one BUILDER. A checker alone has nothing to check.
  * An unreachable model routes EVERY builder and records why. Silently dropping work
    the attendee asked for is worse than running a role that turns out to have nothing
    to do.

# STARTING POINTS, not a catalogue of what the system supports. Each is a request an
# attendee can send as-is, edit, or ignore entirely. They deliberately differ in the
# SHAPE of the work rather than being variations on one task, because the point is to
# show that the same loop closes around any shape:
#
#   * one needs no HTTP at all (so the gate is proven transport-agnostic)
#   * one has no service to probe (so the gate is proven to work on files alone)
#   * one starts from an existing tree (so "do not regress it" becomes the bar)
#   * one starts from a failure (so the reproduction itself is the bar)
#
# `task` is the text the attendee submits. The repository ships THAT SENTENCE and
# nothing else: no module, no scaffold, no contract, no reference solution.
#
# `needs` lists CAPABILITIES, not agent ids. "backend" means "whichever role this
# deployment serves for the service side", so a roster swap (opencode -> Codex, or
# a two-role team) changes nothing here. The checker is NOT listed: every build
# route gets it structurally in `_resolve_needs`, because a build nobody can verify
# is not a valid route.
