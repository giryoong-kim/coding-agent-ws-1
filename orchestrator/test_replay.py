"""The PR body must make the loop legible, and must never become part of it.

A reviewer arriving from a GitHub notification can reach neither the engine log nor
the coordinator session, so the pull request is the only place the run's story can
be told. The old body was two lines ("Automated build for: <task>"), which told them
nothing about who built it or what the gate actually asserted.

The second half of this file is the more important half: `replay` sits on the PR-body
path and must stay off the verdict path. It reports the gate's result; it never
decides one.

Idea from awslabs/aidlc-workflows v2's `aidlc-replay`.
