"""The GitHub preflight must catch the mistakes Lab 2 actually produces.

`status()` answers "does the gateway respond", which is a different question from
"can this App open a pull request on this repo". The Lab 2 mistakes that cost the
most time all pass `tools/list` and then fail at `create_branch`: the App installed
on a different repository, `GITHUB_REPO` naming the wrong owner, a `.pem` that
belongs to another App. Each of those surfaces only AFTER the coordinator is
deployed and a build has already run its agents, which is the most expensive
possible moment to learn about it.

Idea from awslabs/aidlc-workflows v2, which ships `/aidlc --doctor` as its own
step with a named result per check.
