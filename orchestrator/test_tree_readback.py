"""The tree read-back must not try to carry a dependency tree.

A role's work comes back from its Runtime as one `tar | base64` payload over a
WebSocket shell, so the payload has to stay small. An agent that runs
`npm install` creates a `node_modules` of thousands of files: a live run of the
big preset produced 615 files / 4.6MB, the read-back failed, the frontend role
came back holding only its harness files, and the run failed the empty-tree guard
and ended `needs_human` even though the deliverable was sitting on the mount.

Dependency, cache, and virtualenv directories are therefore excluded AT THE TAR,
so they never enter the channel at all. They are reproducible from the manifest
the agent wrote (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`), so nothing a reviewer needs
is lost.
