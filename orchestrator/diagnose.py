"""One command that answers "what is wrong with this box", safe to paste anywhere.

At an event, a facilitator helping one attendee has to ask for the same six things
every time: is the gateway wired, which role Runtimes exist, what did the last run
do, what did the gate say, what is in the engine log. Each answer is a different
command in a different directory, and the attendee is usually already stuck and
short on patience. So this collects them once.

Idea from awslabs/aidlc-workflows v2, whose `--doctor --export` writes a shareable
report rather than only printing a verdict.

**Redaction is allowlist-based, and that is the whole safety argument.** A bundle
exists to be pasted into a chat with a facilitator, so "we removed the things we
thought were secret" is the wrong model -- one unanticipated field and a credential
is in a group chat forever. Instead, every value in the output is either a literal
this module names, or it passed through `_safe`, which reports only the SHAPE of what
it found (present/absent, a length, a suffix). Account ids inside ARNs are masked for
the same reason. The bundle never reads a `.pem`, a token, an API key, or any
Secrets Manager value. Its GitHub doctor check may idempotently prepare the empty
`workshop/doctor` branch; it writes no file and opens no pull request.

It is a diagnostic, not a status API: nothing in the engine reads it back, and it is
never on the verdict path.
