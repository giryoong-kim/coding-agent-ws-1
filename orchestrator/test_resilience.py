"""Resilience tests: the in-process analogues of production durability, proven.

The engine runs in ONE Python process, but every "durable" mechanism in the
references has an in-process twin, and each is unit-testable without an LLM call:

  * a compare-and-swap status transition (conditional write)         -> Run.transition
  * a self-healing lease that evicts a wedged holder (in-flight TTL)  -> _Lease
  * a stranded-run reconciler sweep                                   -> Engine.reconcile
  * an active-count recomputed from the source of truth (no drift)    -> Engine.active_count
  * a two-bucket terminal model (permanent=failed vs transient=needs_human) -> _is_permanent

    python3 -m pytest orchestrator/test_resilience.py -v
