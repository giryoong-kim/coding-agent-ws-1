"""The run, told as a story a reviewer who wasn't there can follow.

A pull request opened by this system arrives with no context. The reviewer sees a
diff and a title, and everything that would let them TRUST the diff -- which roles
ran, what the validator decided to check, whether the gate went red first and why
round 2 happened -- lives in the engine's event log on a box they cannot reach, or
in a coordinator session that has already expired.

So the PR body is the narrative. Not a log dump: a short account of what happened,
in the order it happened, naming who did what and what was proven.

Borrowed from awslabs/aidlc-workflows v2, whose `aidlc-replay` skill exists for
exactly this reason -- it renders their audit trail into a readable story so a
person who wasn't in the room can review the outcome. Same intent here, at our
much smaller scale: their trail spans 32 stages, ours is one bounded loop.

Two constraints shape every line of this module:

  * **It reports; it never judges.** Nothing here decides anything. The gate's
    exit code is the verdict and the reviewer's assessment is the opinion; this
    file reads both after the fact. It is on the PR-body path, never the verdict
    path, so a bug in it cannot turn a red gate green -- the worst it can do is
    describe a run badly.
  * **It states only what the run recorded.** Where a fact is absent (no usage
    reported, no round 2, no endpoint) the narrative says so or omits the line. It
    never infers a number, and it never implies the engine knew something about
    the deliverable that it does not: the engine's whole knowledge is "start what I
    was told to start, run the check I was given".

The body is written ONCE, at `create_pull_request` time (the gateway exposes no
`update_pull_request`), which is why a re-implement round appends its own comment
instead of rewriting history.
