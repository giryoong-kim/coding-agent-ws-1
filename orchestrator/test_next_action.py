"""Every terminal outcome must say what to DO about it.

`needs_human` covers two situations with opposite next steps: validation stayed
blocked on real work (the deliverable needs changing) and a role produced nothing
(transient, just resubmit). The status alone cannot tell them apart, and the raw
`fail_reason` token is not advice. Idea from awslabs/aidlc-workflows v2, whose
stage checkboxes name who is blocking rather than making you decode a state.
