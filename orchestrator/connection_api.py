"""Connection API: the HTTP shell over the embedded orchestration engine.

Serves the frozen contract in API_CONTRACT.md. The shapes have not changed since
the stub days, so the Console built against the stub keeps working now that the
engine (``engine.py``) sits underneath.

    python3 orchestrator/connection_api.py        # serves http://localhost:8090

What happens on POST /api/runs:
  - the engine drives the five-phase blueprint (admission -> context hydration ->
    pre-flight -> agent execution -> finalization) on a worker thread,
  - every routed builder works in an isolated checkout with a unique work id and
    opens one pull request against the repository's DEFAULT branch,
  - then, PER PULL REQUEST: the validator authors an executable for that pull
    request's tree, the engine runs it, one independent review reads that pull
    request alone, and it merges on its own with bounded repair.

There is no race and no winner: builders own separate pull requests, each judged
against the default branch as it stands. No combined candidate, no queue, no final
PR.

Extra (additive, contract-safe) endpoints the engine makes possible:
  GET /api/runs/{id}/events   : the append-only phase journal (the audit trail)

On AgentCore, the engine dispatches through the deployed Runtime targets; this
HTTP layer does not change.
