"""Dispatch a role to its coding-agent deployed on AgentCore Runtime.

This is the shipped, real-only producer: it runs a role's coding-agent CLI INSIDE
the role's deployed AgentCore Runtime container, over the AgentCore command shell
(``AgentCoreRuntimeClient.open_shell`` → ``ShellSession``). There is no in-process
CLI runner on the shipped path; a role's CLI only ever runs in its deployed
Runtime, never on the orchestrator box:

  1. open a WebSocket shell on the role's runtime (SigV4, the server-side path);
  2. download the exact tracked checkout archive and expand it into a run-local
     Git seed on Runtime local disk;
  3. create the role's named Git worktree and run its native headless CLI there;
  4. exclude dependency/cache directories and upload one result archive;
  5. capture STDOUT between sentinels so prompt echo and ANSI noise never pollute
     the transcript.

The role prompts are identical to the in-process path; only WHERE the CLI runs
changes. A missing runtime, a nonzero exit, or a missing/empty artifact raises
``RoleExecutionError``; the run fails loud, it never degrades to a local build.

Why a sync wrapper around an async SDK: the engine drives roles on worker
threads. ``run_in_runtime`` owns its own event loop per call (``asyncio.run`` in
a private thread is unsafe to nest, so we run the coroutine on a fresh loop),
keeping the engine's threading model unchanged.

    deliberately not through ``/app/run.sh`` (which ``cd``s to ``$HOME`` and would
    move the artifact off the run workspace). ``run.sh`` is where the Lab 1
    interactive session gets its key, so a role whose only credential is a vendor
    key had NOTHING on the Lab 2 dispatch path: ``kiro-cli`` then falls through to an
    interactive "Select login method" picker and the headless PTY hangs or fails
    with no explanation.

    Three properties are deliberate, and they are the same ones ``run.sh`` has:

      * The key is fetched with the RUNTIME'S OWN role (``GetWorkloadAccessToken``
        then ``GetResourceApiKey``) at dispatch time, so it is never a runtime
        environment variable on the ARN, where anyone who can ``GetAgentRuntime``
        could read it.
      * It lives only in the CLI subshell's memory. The prelude is emitted INSIDE
        the ``( ... )`` that wraps the CLI, so it never reaches the surrounding
        shell, the archive upload, or the transcript.
      * It FAILS LOUD. An empty fetch prints one actionable line naming the
        provider to fix and returns nonzero WITHOUT running the CLI, rather than
        letting the CLI hang on a login prompt. That mirrors ``run.sh``'s own

    When the box-hosted console is serving this process, the role gets a fresh
    registered interactive PTY: the Agents tab and orchestrator share the native
    TUI and both may send input. The PTY still hydrates one immutable source
    archive into a Runtime-local named worktree; when the turn goes idle, a
    separate bounded shell uploads the result archive without closing the TUI.
    A deployed coordinator has no console registry and uses the existing bounded
    headless path.

    Raises ``RoleExecutionError`` on a nonzero exit or a missing/empty artifact:
    the same fail-loud contract the engine's ``_read_artifact`` enforced locally.

    SAME-PROVIDER RESILIENCE (legacy, now dormant): an OpenAI-on-Bedrock model
    could be de-registered or have a transient outage, surfaced as a nonzero exit
    with a model-down signature. ``llm.openai_sibling`` returns a healthy sibling
    ONLY for an ``openai.*`` model id, so this retry fires only for that provider.
    The frontend role now runs opencode on a Bedrock Claude model, so
    ``openai_sibling`` returns None and this block is a no-op for it; it stays in
    place for any future ``openai.*`` dispatch and is harmless otherwise.

    TESTING SEAM: when ``runtime_arn`` is a local dev URI (``http(s)://…``, what
    ``agentcore dev`` serves), dispatch over HTTP to its ``/invocations`` instead
    of the command shell, so the orchestrator can be exercised end to end against
    a locally-running role WITHOUT a deployed runtime. This is the ONLY non-shell
    producer and it is gated strictly on the URI shape (never reachable for a real
    ARN), so it cannot become a silent local fallback.
