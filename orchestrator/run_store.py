"""Durable run state, so a verdict outlives the session that asked for it.

``run_status`` reads the coordinator process's in-memory registry, which means a
run is only answerable from the SAME AgentCore session that submitted it. An
expired or recycled session loses the verdict permanently: the build still
finished, the pull request still opened, but the attendee has no way to ask what
happened and the workshop page has to warn them about it.

This writes the same public result to durable storage on every phase change, and
reads it back by run id alone. The shape is deliberately the one the API already
returns (``engine.public_result``), so nothing new has to be learned or kept in
sync: the file IS the answer ``run_status`` would have given.

WHERE it writes depends on where the engine is running, and both are existing
seams rather than new infrastructure:

  * a local run (the box console, a dev run) writes under ``_RUNS_DIR/state/``,
    beside the ledger it already appends to;
  * the DEPLOYED coordinator additionally mirrors to the S3 bucket already wired
    into its environment as ``WORKSHOP_RUNTIME_BUCKET``, because its own
    filesystem is a container's ``/tmp`` that dies with the microVM.

Failure to persist is logged and never raised. A status file is a convenience for
reading history; it is not on the verdict path, and a run must not fail because a
bucket was unreachable.
