# Connection API: FROZEN CONTRACT (the Connect layer)

Base URL (local engine): `http://localhost:8090`. All bodies are JSON. CORS is open so the
static console can call it from `file://` or `localhost`.

The model is **fully autonomous orchestration** (no race/winner): submit one task,
give each builder an isolated work item and its own pull request against the default
branch, then take EACH pull request through its own executable check, its own
independent review, and its own merge. No combined candidate, no queue, no final PR.
The API reflects that lifecycle.

## Data shapes

### Run
```json
{
  "run_id": "run_0001",
  "task": "Build a small app with a backend and a frontend",
  "status": "running",                  // queued | running | passed | failed | needs_human
  "phase": "agent_execution",           // the orchestration blueprint phase (see below)
  "created_at": "2026-06-09T07:40:00Z",
  "agents": ["claude-code", "opencode", "kiro"],
  "roles": {                            // role per agent, composed, NOT raced
    "claude-code": "backend-builder",
    "opencode": "frontend-builder",
    "kiro": "validator"
  },
  "route": {                            // the routing verdict (additive; see below)
    "preset": "web-app",
    "rule": "preset 'web-app': Build a web app, front and back",
    "agents": ["claude-code", "opencode", "kiro"],
    "read_only": false
  },
  "fail_reason": null                   // machine-readable reason when status is failed/needs_human
}
```

### Phase (the orchestration blueprint, deterministic except agent_execution)
`admission` → `context_hydration` → `pre_flight` → `agent_execution` → `finalization`
A run also has a terminal status once finalization completes.

### AgentProgress (per role, inside a run's detail)
```json
{
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "role": "backend-builder",
  "state": "done",                      // pending | working | done | error
  "latency_ms": 192340,                 // run metric (observability), NOT a ranking
  "tokens": 184000,
  "cost_usd": 1.84,
  "note": "built the backend side of this request (12 files)",
  "engine": "agentcore"                 // "agentcore" on the shipped path; "" on fixture
}
```

### Result (only meaningful once status is terminal)
```json

}
```

`gate` is the latest executable result for compatibility. `gate_history` is the
complete evidence: the validator authors one check per pull request and the engine
executes it against that pull request's tree, built on the default branch as it
stands. Each row names the `work_id` it judged. A green `gate` never erases an
earlier checkpoint. Builder `work_items` have pull requests; checker work items have
an isolated checkout but no code PR.

`next_action` is DERIVED from `(status, fail_reason, pr)` on every read, never stored:
the reason is the fact, this is how to read it. It exists because `needs_human` covers
both a gate that stayed red on real work and a role that produced nothing (opposite
fixes), and because a PASSING run splits into "the PR opened" and "no PR opened, so
the work is only on a local branch". That second case is NOT a `fail_reason` (the
build succeeded), so it is read from `pr.error`. An unmapped reason yields `""` rather
than invented advice.

`resubmission_allowed` is also derived from `(status, fail_reason)`. It is `false`
for a completed run, for a bounded red gate or review finding such as
`ITERATION_CAP`, and whenever an external prerequisite must change first. It is
`true` only when immediately repeating the same request is an intended recovery,
such as a transient role execution or artifact-transfer failure. Callers must not
offer an immediate retry when this field is false; they still report conditional
future steps from `next_action`, such as waiting for quota to reset.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/health`
Liveness. `200 {"status":"ok","mode":"engine","executor":"agentcore"}` reports the embedded
engine, plus its execution seam (additive field). The shipped path is REAL-ONLY:
`executor` is `agentcore` (each routed role is dispatched to its DEPLOYED AgentCore
Runtime; a role with no wired ARN fails loud, there is no local/in-process producer).
Deterministic offline tests inject a test-only `fixture` executor by constructor, which
reports `executor: "fixture"`.

### `GET /api/agents`
List the served agents + their default role + model, projected from the role registry.
Console renders these on the Stage 1 shelf.
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {"id": "claude-code",           "label": "Claude Code", "default_role": "backend-builder",   "model": "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1",          "credential": "bedrock-native"},
    {"id": "opencode",              "label": "opencode",    "default_role": "frontend-builder",  "model": "amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6", "credential": "runtime-iam"},
    {"id": "kiro",                  "label": "Kiro",        "default_role": "validator",         "model": "",                                         "credential": "api-key"}
  ]
}
```
The list is derived from `roles.py` (the one declarative registry) and is wirable at runtime
via `WORKSHOP_ROLES`. The Claude Code validator and Codex remain in the registry as a restore
path but are not included in the served roster by default.

Kiro's `model` is EMPTY on purpose, and that is an honest fact rather than a missing value:
`kiro-cli` takes no model flag at all, so nothing here can select one. Its model is Kiro's own
`auto` router, written as `chat.defaultModel` into `~/.kiro/settings/cli.json` by its
`run.sh`. Its `credential` is `api-key`: the attendee's own `ksk_`, fetched at session start
from the AgentCore Identity Token Vault and never injected as a runtime environment variable.

### `POST /api/runs`: submit one task (fire-and-forget)
Request:
```json
{
  "task": "Build a small service that converts between units",
  "preset": "service-from-scratch",    // optional; one of the ids from GET /api/presets
  "agents": ["claude-code", "kiro"],   // optional explicit role override
  "options": {}                        // optional per-run overrides (e.g. {"model": "..."})
}
```
Routing is explicit, never a guess: supply `preset` (a starting point), `agents` (an explicit
role list), or both. With neither, `task` alone fails at admission with `PRESET_NOT_SPECIFIED`,
because the coordinator must know which roles to dispatch. Unknown preset: `UNKNOWN_PRESET`.
Unknown role in `agents`: `UNKNOWN_ROLE`. Build with no checker routed: `NO_CHECKER_ROUTED`.

Response `202 Accepted` → a **Run** object (status `queued`, phase `admission`). The caller then
polls `GET /api/runs/{id}`. (Fire-and-forget: the POST returns immediately; the run continues.)

### `GET /api/runs/{run_id}`: poll run status
Returns a **Run** plus a `progress` array of **AgentProgress**:
```json
{
  "run_id": "run_0001", "task": "…", "status": "running", "phase": "agent_execution",
  "created_at": "…",
  "agents": ["claude-code","opencode","kiro"],
  "roles": {"claude-code":"backend-builder","opencode":"frontend-builder",
            "kiro":"validator"},
  "route": {"preset":"web-app","rule":"…","agents":[…],"read_only":false},
  "fail_reason": null,
  "progress": [ /* one AgentProgress per agent */ ]
}
```

### `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/result`: final result
Returns a **Result**. While the run is non-terminal, returns `409 {"status":"running","phase":"…"}`.

### `GET /api/runs`: list recent runs (optional, for a history view)
`{ "runs": [ Run, … ] }`

### `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/events`: the run journal (additive, engine)
Append-only audit trail of phase transitions and role activity (embedded event audit). `{ "run_id": "…", "events": [ {"seq":1,"elapsed_s":0.0,"phase":"admission","level":"info","message":"…"}, … ] }`

### Additive endpoints (the routed engine, all contract-safe extensions)

- **`GET /api/presets`**: the starting points the console renders as chips, resolved from
  the one registry (`presets.PRESETS`) so the console and the engine cannot drift:
  `{ "presets": [ {"preset":"service-from-scratch","title":"Build a small service",
  "roles":["claude-code","kiro"],"task":"…","read_only":false}, … ] }`.
  Every build preset includes the checker in `roles`. `your-own` is always present with
  an empty `task` (the attendee supplies the request).
- **`GET /api/roster`**: the SERVED roles, projected from the one declarative registry
  (`roles.py`). The console renders these instead of keeping its own copy, so the
  sidebar can never advertise an agent this deployment does not run:
  `{ "roster": [ {"role":"claude-code","label":"Claude Code","kind":"builder",
  "capability":"backend","role_name":"backend-builder","description":"…",
  "steering_file":"CLAUDE.md","model":"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1",
  "credential":"bedrock-native"}, … ] }`.
- **`GET /api/runs/{id}/terminals`**: per-role shell transcripts (every line a real
  `/bin/sh` command the role ran in its container, with output + exit code):
  `{ "run_id":"…", "terminals": {"claude-code":[{"cmd":"…","output":"…","exit":0,"elapsed_s":0.1}], …},
  "events": {…} }`. The `events` field carries the structured per-role agent event
  stream (text/thinking/tool_use/tool_result) the console renders as live tool calls.
- **`GET /api/runs/{id}/diff`**: the composed change as a per-file unified diff (the
  session Changes tab's data), read from this run's own commit in the composed repo:
  `{ "run_id":"…", "commit":"…"|null, "branch":"run/…", "files": [{"path":"claude-code/server.py",
  "added":42,"removed":0,"patch":"@@ …"}, …] }`. `files` is empty (with `reason`) until
  the gate is green and the commit lands. Each run's commit roots at the empty base, so
  its diff is exactly its own deliverable set (the same invariant the PR path assumes).
- **`GET /api/github`** / **`POST /api/github`**: the real-PR credential ladder status
  (env var → Secrets Manager → settings file → local mode) and the Settings-pane
  save/clear. Storage backend: `WORKSHOP_GITHUB_STORE=secretsmanager` (the workshop box)
  stores the repo config in AWS Secrets Manager (`status().source` = `secrets-manager`);
  the default `local` keeps the gitignored 0600 settings file (`source` = `settings`),
  and any Secrets Manager failure degrades to that file transparently. The GitHub App
  credential (repo + optional gateway URL) never surfaces beyond a masked summary.

### Additive fields on Run / Result (the routed engine)

- `Run.route`: the routing verdict: `{"preset","rule","agents","read_only"}`. `preset` is
  the id from `GET /api/presets`, or `"custom"` when `agents` was given explicitly.
  `rule` is a human-readable explanation for the run log. `agents` is the resolved
  role list; `read_only` is true for review-only routes (no builder dispatched).
  Absent until the run exits admission (the router sets it there).
- `Result.review`: the independent integrated-review verdict:
  `{"state":"approved"|"changes_requested","lgtm":bool,"round":n,"gate":{…},
  "reasons":[…],"assessment":"…","panels":[…],"review_unavailable":bool}`.
  The list-shaped `panels` field remains for persisted-run compatibility; new runs
  record one row with `name: "integrated"`, display `label`, `state`
  (`approved`, `changes_requested`, or `abstained`), `model`, `reasons`,
  `assessment`, the two optional `lenses` fields, and an optional abstention
  `note`.
  `reasons` is the list of change-request feedback items fed back to the routed roles on a
  re-implement pass. `assessment` is the full markdown posted on the PR.
  Pass token is the exact string `LGTM: no changes needed`; non-LGTM buys ONE bounded
  re-implement pass (`MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`) PER PULL REQUEST. One read-only model turn
  reviews ONE pull request and never reuses a builder conversation. Its response must
  contain both adversarial-verification and design/integration lenses; a finding
  under either lens stops that pull request from merging. An unreachable reviewer is
  recorded as `abstained`, sets `review_unavailable`, and holds that pull request with
  `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`; builders are not asked to repair a model outage.
- `Result.pr`: GitHub finalization: `{"pr_url":…}` when connected, `{"skipped":…}` in local
  mode, `{"error":…}` on a real failure. `pr_url` is real or null, never fake.

## Status / phase state machine (what the engine drives and any deployment must honor)

```
POST /api/runs
   └─> queued (admission)
        └─> running (context_hydration)
             └─> running (pre_flight)        // fail-closed: may go -> failed here
                  └─> running (agent_execution)   // builders in parallel; checker after their join
                       └─> running (finalization)  // per pull request: gate -> review -> merge
                            ├─> passed        (every PR settled: merged, or green and awaiting a person)
                            ├─> failed        (no PR reached a check)
                            └─> needs_human   (ROLE_PR_BLOCKED naming the open work ids)
```

## Rules the real implementation must keep (so the Console never breaks)
1. **Never change a field name or status/phase enum without editing THIS file + telling the group.**
2. `pr_url` is `null` until `finalization` opens it. `result` is `409` until terminal.
3. Per-agent `latency_ms` / `tokens` / `cost_usd` are **run metrics** (observability), never a
   ranking; there is no "winner" field, by design.
4. `roles` always maps each agent to a distinct job (compose-not-compete).
