"""Wirable AgentCore runtime config: the deployed ARNs are SET, never hardcoded.

When the orchestrator runs with ``WORKSHOP_EXECUTOR=agentcore`` it dispatches each
role to a coding agent deployed on its own AgentCore Runtime. Those runtime ARNs
are not known until the attendee deploys, so they must be wirable, not baked into
code. This module is that surface, mirroring ``github.py``'s credential ladder:

  1. environment: ``AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_<ROLE>`` (CI / pre-provisioned), or the
     orchestrator's own ``AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ID`` / ``BEDROCK_AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN``.
  2. the Settings pane: written to a gitignored ``.runs/runtime.local.json``
     (0600), the same place GitHub creds land. Attendees paste the ARN the
     ``agentcore deploy`` output printed, or set it from the terminal.

FLEET, not singletons: a role may have MORE THAN ONE deployed runtime ("3 types"
does not mean exactly 3 instances; the fleet may be 2 Claude Code + 5 opencode + 1
Kiro). So each role wires to a LIST of ARNs: a single string is one instance, a
JSON list (or a comma-separated env value) is a fleet. ``pick(role)`` round-robins
across a role's instances so concurrent runs spread their dispatch over the fleet;
``resolve(role)`` returns the first instance (the single-instance answer the
governance/cost views and presence checks use).

``resolve(role)`` / ``pick(role)`` return None for an unwired role (the executor
fails loud rather than silently running it locally). Nothing here is a secret
(an ARN is not a credential), but we keep the 0600 file discipline anyway so the
config surface is identical to GitHub's and there is one place to look.
