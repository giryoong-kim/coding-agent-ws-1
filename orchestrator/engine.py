"""The embedded orchestration engine: routed, reviewed, and terminal-transparent.

Production orchestrators implement this as a durable function (checkpoint/replay,
suspension, condition-based polling). This module is the same design, embedded:
one in-process engine that drives every task through the same deterministic state
machine. It is real-only: each role's artifact is produced by dispatching that role
to its DEPLOYED AgentCore Runtime. There is no local, in-process, or model-in-process
producer on the shipped path, and a missing wired runtime fails loud rather than
silently building locally. The producer sits behind the execution seam
(``executor.Executor``): ``AgentCoreExecutor`` (the shipped default,
``InvokeAgentRuntime`` / command-shell dispatch against deployed role runtimes).

The central design rules are:

  * **Registry-derived routing.** ``roles.py`` declares the available roles once,
    and ``presets.py`` selects capabilities rather than agent ids. ``chat.py``
    generates dispatch tools from the active roster and lets the Strands
    coordinator clarify an ambiguous request. Only selected roles are dispatched.
  * **A separate checker and reviewer** (``reviewer.py``). The build side never
    approves its own work: the validator authors an executable check for the pull
    request in front of it and real execution supplies the gate verdict. The
    reviewer then posts its Assessment on that pull request. A red gate or a
    requested change returns only the owning role through one bounded repair pass.
  * **One pull request per role, each merged on its own** (``github.py``). Every
    builder owns a named branch and opens a pull request against the repository's
    DEFAULT branch. There is no assembled candidate, no run-scoped integration
    branch, no merge queue, and no separate final pull request: a pull request is
    the unit a person reviews and merges, so the engine does not invent a second
    unit above it. Each one is checked and reviewed against the default branch AS
    IT STANDS, which is what keeps a cross-role defect catchable: once one role's
    pull request merges, the next role's check runs against a tree containing it.
    A red pull request never blocks a green sibling. Without credentials the PR
    field carries a typed error and ``pr_url`` stays null.

Every role works in its own container directory and leaves a TERMINAL TRANSCRIPT:
``/bin/sh`` commands with their output (installing its harness by writing the
steering file, probing the module, booting the server, running the gate), plus, on
the dispatched role, the live CLI session that ran INSIDE the deployed Runtime,
read back over the command shell. The console streams these transcripts into
per-role xterm panes: what you watch is what ran.

How a role's artifact is produced (the step behind the execution seam):

  * **AgentCore Runtime (shipped, real-only)**: each role's coding-agent CLI runs
    INSIDE its deployed Runtime and writes WHATEVER its task calls for; the engine
    names no file for a builder. The engine dispatches over the command shell
    (``runtime_exec`` via ``engine._runtime_cli``) against the role's WIRED runtime
    ARN and reads the role's work back as a whole tree (an empty tree is the failure,
    see ``_require_work``). The one filename that IS part of a contract is the
    validator's authored check, because the engine has to execute that file to read
    its exit code. A role with no wired runtime fails loud; there is no local
    fallback.

The executor is selected at startup from ``WORKSHOP_EXECUTOR`` (default / ``""`` /
``agentcore`` -> ``AgentCoreExecutor``; unknown values fail loud). Deterministic
OFFLINE TESTS inject a test-only ``FixtureExecutor`` (``fixture_executor.py``) by
constructor. Test-owned fixture outputs exercise the lifecycle, gate plumbing,
reviewer, compose, and PR tail without a model or live AWS. They are not a
customer-path builder or answer key. No env flag selects a fake on the shipped
binary, and no shipped module imports the fixture.

Run it (always via the HTTP shell, ``connection_api.py``):

#     agents' deliverable, and it is identical in every run.

#     deliverable, so a real 3-role run committed `issues.db` next to
#     `issues.db-wal` and `issues.db-shm`: one run's state, published as source.
#
# The database file goes with its sidecars, and that pairing is the point. In WAL

# an `issues.db` whose tables existed and whose row counts were all zero, because
# the data was in the WAL we correctly left out. Half a database is worse than
# neither half, so the whole set goes.

        When any pull request MERGED, the base-branch snapshot is that answer: each
        merge re-snapshots the branch, so the snapshot accumulates every merged
        role's work. Using the last single pull request's tree instead would drop the
        earlier roles' files, which is exactly the bug this comment exists to prevent.

        With nothing merged (``human_review``, or a blocked run), fall back to the
        last pull request tree that was built at all, so a run still composes
        something a person can read.
