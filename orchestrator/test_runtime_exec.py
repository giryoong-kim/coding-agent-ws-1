"""runtime_exec unit tests (offline): the CLI-level same-provider fallback.

The shipped path runs a role's coding-agent CLI inside its deployed runtime over
the command shell. codex's OpenAI-on-Bedrock model (gpt-5.5) can be de-registered
or have a transient backend outage; the CLI reports that as a nonzero exit with a
model-down signature in its output (it talks to the mantle endpoint itself, so
there is no HTTPError to classify). run_in_runtime then retries ONCE on the healthy
sibling model, the CLI-level analogue of llm._invoke_openai's HTTP fallback.

These tests stub the SHELL DISPATCH seam (_dispatch_once) and the artifact read,
so they run with no AWS, no runtime, no network.
