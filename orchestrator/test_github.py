"""GitHub Gateway tests for the per-pull-request flow.

One pull request per role, each based on the repository's DEFAULT branch, each
checked, reviewed, and merged on its own. There is no assembled candidate, no merge
queue, and no final integration pull request, so nothing here pins an order between
pull requests: a red one never blocks a green sibling.

Every test in this module runs against a fake ``_gateway_rpc``, and the settings and
merge-policy files are redirected into ``tmp_path`` (on top of the suite-wide
``WORKSHOP_GITHUB_SETTINGS`` isolation in ``conftest.py``). No test may reach a real
gateway or open a real pull request.
